## Option 1: Real ESP32 Hardware ⭐ RECOMMENDED

### What You Get
✅ Real physical control of appliances  
✅ Real sensor readings  
✅ Full dashboard integration  
✅ Production-ready system  

### What You Need
- ESP32 board ($5-10)
- Relay modules ($10-15)
- DHT22 sensor ($5-10)
- Jumper wires ($5)

### Setup Steps
1. **Buy hardware** (Amazon, AliExpress, local electronics store)
2. **Upload firmware**: Use `esp32-firmware/smart-home.ino`
3. **Connect to WiFi**: Your credentials already in code ("MCO")
4. **It just works!** Dashboard automatically syncs

### Files to Use
```
esp32-firmware/
└── smart-home.ino  ← Use this file (already has Firebase!)
```

### Why This Works
The `smart-home.ino` file already includes:
- ✅ WiFi connection
- ✅ Firebase integration
- ✅ Device state listening
- ✅ Sensor data uploading
- ✅ Real-time sync with dashboard

**Status:** 🟢 Ready - Just need hardware!

## Option 3: Wokwi Simulation ⚠️ LIMITED

### What You Get
✅ Test GPIO logic  
✅ Test sensor readings  
✅ Serial command control  
❌ No Firebase connection  
❌ No dashboard integration  

### Limitation
**Wokwi cannot make real internet connections**, so it cannot connect to Firebase or your dashboard.

### What It's Good For
- Learning ESP32 programming
- Testing GPIO logic
- Verifying pin connections
- Understanding code flow

### What It Cannot Do
- Connect to WiFi
- Access Firebase
- Sync with dashboard
- Make HTTP requests

### Files to Use
```
esp32-firmware/
└── smart-home-wokwi.ino  ← Wokwi version (no Firebase)
```

### Documentation
See: `WOKWI_SETUP.md`

**Status:** 🟡 For learning only - Cannot connect to dashboard
