# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

## General Questions

### What is this project?
A complete IoT-based smart home automation system that lets you control home appliances remotely using ESP32 microcontroller and a web dashboard built with React.js and Firebase.

### What can I control?
Any appliance that can be connected to a relay module - lights, fans, air conditioners, heaters, coffee makers, etc. The system also monitors environmental sensors like temperature and humidity.

### Is this safe to use with AC appliances?
‚ö†Ô∏è **Working with AC power can be dangerous.** If you're not experienced with electrical work, start with DC appliances (12V lights, fans) or consult an electrician. Always follow local electrical codes.

### How much does it cost?
- **Hardware**: $30-45 (ESP32, relays, sensors, wires)
- **Software**: Free (Firebase Spark plan, Vercel hobby plan)
- **Operating**: <$1/month (electricity)

## Setup Questions

### Do I need a Firebase account?
Yes, Firebase provides the cloud database and authentication. The free "Spark" plan is sufficient for personal use.

### Do I need coding experience?
Basic coding knowledge helps, but the provided code is ready to use. You mainly need to:
1. Update WiFi credentials
2. Configure Firebase settings
3. Upload code to ESP32

### Can I use a different microcontroller?
The code is written for ESP32, but can be adapted for:
- ESP8266 (similar WiFi board)
- Arduino with WiFi shield
- Raspberry Pi

ESP32 is recommended for its built-in WiFi and affordability.

### What WiFi do I need?
- **2.4GHz WiFi** (ESP32 doesn't support 5GHz)
- Stable internet connection
- Access to router settings (for troubleshooting)

## Technical Questions

### How fast is the response time?
- **Device control**: <1 second from button click to relay activation
- **Sensor updates**: Every 10 seconds (configurable)
- **Dashboard refresh**: Real-time via WebSocket

### How many devices can I add?
- **Recommended**: 3-10 devices per ESP32
- **Maximum**: Limited by available GPIO pins (~18 usable pins)
- **Multiple ESP32s**: Can be used for more devices

### Can I control devices without internet?
Not with the current architecture. The system requires internet for Firebase communication. Future versions could add local WiFi control.

### Is the data secure?
- Dashboard requires authentication (Firebase Auth)
- HTTPS encryption for all communications
- Firebase security rules control access
- **For production**: Enable Firebase Authentication rules

### What happens if WiFi disconnects?
- ESP32 attempts to reconnect automatically
- Devices maintain their last known state
- Dashboard shows "offline" status
- No data is lost (stored in Firebase)

## Hardware Questions

### What ESP32 board should I buy?
Any ESP32 development board works:
- ESP32-DevKitC (recommended)
- ESP32-WROOM-32
- ESP32-NodeMCU
- Look for: USB port, 30+ pins, built-in WiFi

### What relays do I need?
- **Voltage**: 5V (powered by ESP32)
- **Type**: Optically isolated (safer)
- **Channels**: 1-channel per device (or multi-channel modules)
- **Current rating**: Match your appliance (usually 10A is sufficient)

### Do I need a DHT22 sensor?
No, it's optional. You can:
- Use DHT22 for temperature/humidity
- Use other sensors (motion, light, gas)
- Skip sensors and only control devices

### Can I power ESP32 from USB?
- **Yes** for development and light loads
- **No** for multiple relays (insufficient current)
- **Solution**: Use 5V/2A power adapter for relays

## Dashboard Questions

### Can I access the dashboard from anywhere?
Yes! Once deployed to Vercel or Firebase Hosting, you can access it from:
- Any web browser
- Desktop, tablet, mobile
- Anywhere with internet

### Does it work on mobile?
Yes! The dashboard is fully responsive and works on:
- iOS (Safari, Chrome)
- Android (Chrome, Firefox)
- Tablets
- Desktop browsers

### Can multiple users access it?
Yes! Add users in Firebase Authentication:
1. Go to Firebase Console ‚Üí Authentication
2. Add user with email/password
3. All users can log in and control devices

### Can I customize the interface?
Absolutely! The code is open and modular:
- Change colors in `tailwind.config.js`
- Modify components in `src/components/`
- Add new features easily

---

## Troubleshooting

### ESP32 won't connect to WiFi
1. Check SSID and password are correct
2. Ensure 2.4GHz network (not 5GHz)
3. Move ESP32 closer to router
4. Check Serial Monitor for error messages
5. Restart ESP32 and router

### Dashboard shows "No devices"
1. Check Firebase Realtime Database has device data
2. Verify Firebase config in `firebase.js`
3. Check database security rules
4. Open browser console for errors
5. Ensure you're logged in

### Can't login to dashboard
1. Verify user exists in Firebase Authentication
2. Check email/password are correct
3. Clear browser cache and cookies
4. Check Firebase Auth is enabled
5. Try creating a new user

### Relays not switching
1. Check GPIO pin connections
2. Verify relay gets 5V power
3. Test relay with manual HIGH/LOW
4. Check relay LED indicators
5. Verify relay module is functional

### Sensor shows NaN (Not a Number)
1. Check DHT22 connections (Data, VCC, GND)
2. Wait 2 seconds after power-on
3. Try different GPIO pin
4. Test sensor with example code
5. Replace sensor if faulty
